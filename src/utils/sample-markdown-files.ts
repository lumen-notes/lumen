# 👋 Welcome to Lumen

Lumen is a free, [open-source](https://github.com/lumen-notes/lumen) markdown note-taking app backed by git.

Think of Lumen as your _private knowledge garden_. It's where you plant, grow, and harvest ideas.

- 🌱 **Plant**: Capture notes that are seamlessly synced to a GitHub repository of your choice as markdown files. Your data is never locked in.
- 🌿 **Grow**: Connect your notes with links and tags. Lumen makes it easy to explore and discover new connections.
- 🧑‍🌾 **Harvest**: Access your notes from any device, even offline. Use Lumen's flexible search syntax to find what you're looking for.

You're currently viewing Lumen in read-only mode. Feel free to explore!

When you're ready to write notes, sign in with GitHub and connect a repository.
