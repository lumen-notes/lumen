# Changelog

## 2026-W06

### Improved

- Cheatsheet dialog replaced with a help panel (⌘/) that stays open while you work, so you can reference shortcuts or markdown syntax without interrupting what you're doing.
- Hovering a footnote reference now shows a preview of the footnote content, so you can read it without jumping to the bottom of the page.
- "Read" and "Write" renamed to "View" and "Edit" in the note page mode switcher for clarity.

### Fixed

- Quotes in shared note titles now display correctly in link previews (e.g. when sharing a note on Discord or Twitter).
