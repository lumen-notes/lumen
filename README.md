# Lumen

Lumen is a free, open-source note-taking app for lifelong learners.

[**Open Lumen →**](https://app.uselumen.com)

<br>

Think of Lumen as your private knowledge garden. It's where you plant, grow, and harvest ideas.

### 🌱 Plant

Write notes with [markdown](/docs/markdown-syntax.md) and store them as plain text files in a GitHub repository of your choice. You own your data. Forever.

### 🌿 Grow

Connect your notes with links and tags. Lumen makes it easy to explore your knowledge graph and discover new connections.

### 🌻 Harvest

Access your notes from anywhere—even offline. Use Lumen's flexible [query language](/docs/query-language.md) to find exactly what you're looking for.

<br>

Notes in Lumen are...

- written in [markdown](/docs/markdown-syntax.md)
- stored as files on GitHub
- version-controlled with Git
- interconnected
- searchable
- available offline
- accessible on any device
- compatible with [other apps](#alternatives)
