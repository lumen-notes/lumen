Think of Lumen as your _private knowledge garden_. It's where you plant, grow, and harvest ideas.

 - **🌱 Plant**

   Write notes with [markdown](/docs/markdown-syntax.md) and store them as plain text files in a GitHub repository of your choice. You own your data. Forever.

 - **🌿 Grow**

   Connect your notes with links and tags. Lumen makes it easy to explore your knowledge graph and discover new connections.

 - **🌻 Harvest**

   Access your notes from anywhere—even offline. Use Lumen's flexible [query language](/docs/query-language.md) to find exactly what you're looking for.
