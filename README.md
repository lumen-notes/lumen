Think of Lumen as your _private knowledge garden_. It's where you plant, grow, and harvest ideas.

 - **ðŸŒ± Plant**

   Write notes in [markdown](/docs/markdown-syntax.md) files and store them in a GitHub repository of your choice. You own your data, forever.

 - **ðŸŒ¿ Grow**

   Connect your notes with links and tags. Lumen makes it easy to explore your knowledge graph and discover new connections.

 - **ðŸŒ» Harvest**

   Access your notes from anywhereâ€”even offline. Use Lumen's flexible [query language](/docs/query-language.md) to find exactly what you're looking for.
